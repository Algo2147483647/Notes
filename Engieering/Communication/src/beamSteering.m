function [IndexAt,IndexAr] = findSteeringVector(H,At,Ar,Ns)
%%% This is the function to obtain the beam steering vectors at the transmitter and receiver 
%%% by finding the array response vectors corresponding to the largest effective channel gain (an exhaustive search).
%%% Only suitable for single data stream case.

% Input
%       H     : channel matrix, Nr x Nt
%       At    : the collection of transmit steering vectors, Nt x NumPath

% Output
%      IndexAt : index of the path selected at the transmitter
%      IndexAr : index of the path selected at the receiver
