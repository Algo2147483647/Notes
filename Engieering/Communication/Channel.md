# Channel

[TOC]

## Define

A channel is a medium or path for information transmission, which can be a physical medium (such as cables, optical fibers) or a wireless medium (such as radio waves, microwaves). The channel is responsible for transmitting the signal generated by the sender to the receiver, and is affected by various factors such as noise, fading, and interference.

## Property

### Bandwidth

Bandwidth is the frequency range of signals that a channel can transmit. Usually expressed in Hertz (Hz). The bandwidth determines the upper limit of the channel's information transmission rate.

### Latency

Delay is the time required for a signal to travel from the sending end to the receiving end. It includes factors such as propagation delay, processing delay, and queuing delay.

### Signal-to-Noise Ratio

The signal-to-noise ratio is the ratio of a signal to noise. A higher signal-to-noise ratio indicates better signal quality, while a lower signal-to-noise ratio can lead to signal distortion and errors.

### Channel Capacity


$$
C = \max_{\mathbb P(x)} I(X;Y)
$$
Maximum value of average mutual information between input and output; A measure of maximum information rate capability in channel transmission
