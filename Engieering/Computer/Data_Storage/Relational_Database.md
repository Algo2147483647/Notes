# Database Paradigm

- 1NF: **Ensures the Atomicity of Each Column**
- 2NF: **Non-Key Attributes Are Fully Dependent on the Primary Key**
- 3NF: **No Non-Key Attribute Depends on Another Non-Key Attribute**

# Transactions

## Principles 

* **Atomicity**: ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. Either all the changes made by the transaction are applied, or none of them are. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database remains unchanged. 

* **Consistency**: ensures that a transaction takes the database from one consistent state to another. If a transaction violates these rules, it will be rejected, and the database will remain unchanged.

* **Isolation**: ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. This prevents issues like dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads. 

* **Durability**: guarantees that once a transaction is successfully completed, its changes are permanently saved and will survive any subsequent system failures, such as power outages or crashes.

## Isolation Level

Problem:

- **Dirty reads**: occurs when one transaction reads data that is being modified by another transaction that hasn't been committed yet, such as rolling back one transaction and affecting another.
- **Non-repeatable reads**: occur when a transaction reads a piece of data and, while the transaction is still active, another transaction modifies or deletes that same piece of data and commits the change. 
- **Phantom reads**: happen when a transaction reads a set of rows that satisfy a certain condition, but while the transaction is still active, another transaction inserts, updates, or deletes rows that match that condition, causing the initial transaction to see a different set of rows when it reads again.

Solution:

* **READ-UNCOMMITTED**: 
  * This is the lowest isolation level.

  * Transactions can read data modified by other transactions that haven't been committed yet.

  * It can lead to dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.

* **READ-COMMITTED**: 
  * Transactions can only read committed data.

  * It prevents dirty reads but may still lead to non-repeatable reads and phantom reads.

* **REPEATABLE-READ**: 
  * This level ensures that data read by a transaction will not change until the transaction is complete.

  * It uses locks to maintain consistency, preventing even committed updates from affecting the transaction.

  * Non-repeatable reads are prevented, but phantom reads (new rows appearing) can still occur.

* **SERIALIZABLE**: 
  * This is the highest isolation level.
  * Transactions are fully isolated from each other.
  * It prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads, but can also cause higher contention and performance issues due to locking.

### *Q: Non-repeatable reads vs. Phantom reads?*

Non-repeatable reads focus on modification, and phantom reads focus on adding or deleting rows.

## Locks

* Shared locks
* Exclusive locks
* Update locks

### Lock Granularity  

* Table Locks
* Row Locks
  * MCVV, Multi-Version Concurrency Control

### *Q: B Tree vs. B+ Tree?*

- Structure and Nodes:
  - B Tree: In a B tree, each node can have multiple keys and child pointers.
  - B+ Tree: In a B+ tree, keys are only stored in the leaf nodes. It makes the search more efficient since we can store more keys in internal nodes â€“ this means we need to access fewer nodes.
- Leaf nodes in a B+ tree are linked together making range search operations efficient and quick.
